        <p>Both these texts, As We May Know It and Long Live the Web, discuss the impacts new technology has, can have, and has had on humans. It is cool to see really how much our lives have changed because of new technical advances. They both have many interesting points that both agree and disagree with each other. </p>
        
        <p>In As We May Know It the author talks about how without certain machines, humans would be very much less successful in life, which I thought was interesting, but also very true. The author says, “Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines”, referring to typewriters and meaning without these, many people would not have the certain success they have.</p>

        <p>Long Live the Web has a more optimistic tone to it, Tim Lee urges people to use the web for good and to advance further than we already have. He also goes into some technical aspects of how the web works which I thought was interesting to read about since I didn’t know a lot of what he is talking about before. </p>
        
        <p>These two essays were very informative and sparked some interest in me. They made me think about what roles the web and technology plays in my daily life and how much they are apparent in it.</p>
