        <h1>Midterm Proposal!</h1>
        <p>how i'll go about doing this:</p>
        <p>from the wireframes it is easy to see that i'll be needing to use a lot of css grid because of the many irregular placements if things like pictures and text boxes. That'll be my biggest problem I think.</p>
        <p> I will also be needing to look into color and which ones I like best and which ones I think look most pleasing to the eye (I think the colors in the wireframes are too bright).</p>
        <p> an issue that may come up is just how many html files and external images i will need to store in order to make this site functional.</p>
