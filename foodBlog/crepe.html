        <h3 id="h3">STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, salt, and milk.</li>
          <li>Sift in flour and whisk until smooth.</li>
          <li>Strain the batter to further remove lumps.</li>
          <li>Butter an 8-12" non stick pan and place on nedium-low heat.</li>
          <li>Take a 1/3 or 1/2 measuring cup and scoop out batter and pour onto the pan.</li>
          <li>Quickly pick up the pan and move it around in a circular motion, guiding the batter so it covers the whole pan. Allow this side to cook for 1-2 min or until done.</li>
          <li>Once the top start to bubble, carefully take a spatula and shimmy it underneath the crepe. Pick it up and quickly flip. Cook for another 1-2 min.</li>
          <li>Continue cooking the crepes until you've used up all your batter.</li>
          <li>Allow the crepes to cool. Meanwhile, whip your cream and sugar until soft peaks form, add in nutella and keep whipping until stiff peaks form and the nutella is fully combined.</li>
          <li>To assemble, start with a crepe, place it on a plate or a lazy susan. Add a thin layer of your whipped cream followed by a layer of your thinly sliced strawberries. Add another thin layer of whipped cream ontop to help the next crepe stick. Repeat until you have used all your crepes.</li>
          <li>Cover the sides and top of the cake with the remainder of your whipped cream. Decorate with strawberries and allow to chill for 3 hours or over night.</li>
          <li>Cut (or don't) and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="h3">NOTES</h3>
        <li>Crepes are super dificult to make, and the first one is never pretty. But keep practicing and you'll get there.</li>
        <li>Temperature control is very important for the pan, make sure it never gets too hot (and also too cold). If your crepes are burning or cooking too fast, just take the pan off the heat for a bit to let it cool. DO NOT RUN IT UNDER COLD WATER TO COOL IT OFF. This will warp and damage the pan in the long run.</li>
        <li>Make sure your batter is smooth with no lumps. If you forget to sift in your flour, just make sure to strain the batter a few more times.</li>
        <li>If you can't seem to get the right amount of batter for each crepe, try pouring more than you need into the pan and then pouring the excess right back out. This is also a super effective way to get an even crepe.</li>
        <li>I sometimes forget to write things down as I go so the measurments for the filling are a guess (not the cream part, I just used the while 1 pint carton). My suggestion is the make the filling to your liking because that is the most crucial part! If it is too sweet, less sugar, if it is not nutella-y enough, more nutella! Don't skip out on the sugar totally though because the cream won't whip up without it.</li>
