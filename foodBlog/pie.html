                <ol>
                    <li>Staring with the crust dough, whisk your flour, sugar, and salt together.</li>
                    <li>In a seprate bowl with half of your cold cubed butter, pour your flour mixture in and use a pastry cutter or two forks to cut the flour into the butter until the mixture resembles pea sized crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Working quickly, add the remainder of your butter until just combined. Your dough should be very dry and very crumbly.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle your ice cold water over the mixture little by little and continue cutting in until only small spots of flour remain at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour your dough onto a clean surface and bring the rest together with your hands. Do not over work.</li>
                    <li>Split the dough into a 2/3 and a 1/3 section. Wrap both sections tightly with plastic wrap and from into a flat disc. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the dough is chilling, make your filling. Take your strawberries and mix in your tapioca, sugar, and lemon juice. Allow the filling to macerate for 15 - 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Roll the 2/3 section of dough out on a clean surface to a flat circle about 1/8-1/4" thick. Press this into your pie dish and trim the edges. Make sure to puch all the way down to the corners of your dish.</li>
                    <li>Pour all of your filling in and take the remaining 1/3 of your dough to create a lattice pie top.</li>
                    <li>Use a fork to press down around the rim of the crust and create a ruffled pattern.</li>
                    <li>Brush the lattice with milk and sprinkle with large sugar crystals. </li>
                    <li>Bake at 425&#176 for 15 minutes. Then turn the heat down to 350&#176 and bake for another 40 minutes or until browned and bubbling.</li>
                    <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="h3">NOTES</h3>
                <li>If you want to make this strawberry rhubarb pie, just use 2 cups rhubarb and 3 cups strawberries instead of the full 5 cups being strawberries. Also do not include the lemon juice.</li>
                <li>For baking pies, it is crucial that you keep your dough (specifically the butter) as cold as possible at all times. This is why you must work quickly and use ice cold water for it. When your cold crust goes straight into the oven, the butter will release steam as it melts, creating air pockets, giving your crust those nice flakey layers.</li>
                <li>You can replace the tapioca with cornstarch or whatever thickiner you like. I think the tapioca gives it a more complex flavor though.</li>
                <li>Cooling the cake completely is important so you give time for the filling to set and it doesnt all spill out when you try to cut a slice.</li>
