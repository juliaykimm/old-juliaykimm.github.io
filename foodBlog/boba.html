        <ol>
          <li>Staring with the dough, combine brown sugar and water in a sauce pan. Heat on medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. STIR CONSTANTLY.</li>
          <li>When just boiling, turn off the heat and add a bit (~ tablespoon) of tapioca starch. Mix well until starch is dissolved.</li>
          <li>Place back on the heat and stir continuously until the mixture is thick and goopy.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat and the rest of your tapioca starch. Combine until all the starch is loosely incorporated. The dough should be crumbly and stringy.</li>
          <li>Pour it out onto a clean surface lightly dusted with tapioca starch. Knead while still warm until no starch can be seen (1-2 min). The dough should be soft and supple with little to no cracking. </li>
          <li>Form the dough into a log and cut in half. Cover one half with a damp towel or saran wrap to prevent it from drying out.</li>
          <li>Roll out thin logs and cut those into even .25-.50inch pieces. Roll them out into balls and place in a bowl with extra tapioca starch (to prevent the balls from sticking to each other).</li>
          <li>Boil a large pot of water (recommended 10:1 cup water to pearl ratio) and pour in the pearls. Stir constantly to prevent sticking.</li>
          <li>Once the pearls float to the top, leave it to boil for 20 minutes without a lid.</li>
          <li>After 20 minutes, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let them sit for another 20 minutes. </li>
          <li>Drain the water out and dunk the pearls in room temperature or cold water to rinse them. They should be slimy.</li>
          <li>In a small pot on medium-high heat, combine your brown sugar and water for the syrup. Pour the rinsed pearls in and boil until thick and syrup like.</li>
          <li>Serve with milk or any tea of your choice!</li>

        <h3 id="h3">NOTES</h3>
        <li>The hardest part about this is making sure your dough isn't too dry. If it is, your pearls will have less of a chew to them and be hard and crumbly. Make sure you do not let your dough dry out while rolling out each ball!</li>
        <li>If you don't have dark brown sugar light brown works just as well.</li>
        <li>I recommend you serve this with plain cold milk since the pearl and the syrup already have so much sugar and flavor in them.</li>
        <li>Boiling 10 cups of water per 1 cup of pearls isn't actually necessary that ratio is simply there to make sure you have enough water for your pearls to not be sticking together when cooking.</li>
        <li>I have heard that rinsing your pearls in warm water is actaully better because the cold water will make them harder. This has never been the case for me but you're welcome to rinse them in whatever temperature water you like. I learned that the cold water makes them chewier.</li>
        <li>This recipe takes a lot of time and patience but it is so worth it :)</li>
